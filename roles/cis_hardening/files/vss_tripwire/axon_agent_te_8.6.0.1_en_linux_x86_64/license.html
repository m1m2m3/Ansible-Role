<p><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</b>

<p><b>TRIPWIRE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED, NOT SOLD. USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO 
LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. CAREFULLY READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT BEFORE USING THE 
SOFTWARE. USE OF SOFTWARE INDICATES COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF 
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. ANY ADDITIONAL OR 
DIFFERENT PURCHASE ORDER TERMS AND CONDITIONS SHALL NOT APPLY.</b>

<h3>END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Agreement")</h3>

<p>Clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the Software (defined below) 
establishes a binding agreement between Tripwire, Inc. ("Tripwire") and you as 
the person or entity licensing the Software ("Customer"); provided that if you 
are accepting this Agreement on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that 
you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case 
the term "Customer" refers to such entity. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY 
OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, IMMEDIATELY 
RETURN, OR IF RECEIVED ELECTRONICALLY, CERTIFY DESTRUCTION OF SOFTWARE AND ALL 
ACCOMPANYING ITEMS, AND YOU WILL RECEIVE A FULL REFUND OF ANY LICENSE FEE 
PAID. Unless a separate license agreement has been signed by Customer and an 
authorized representative of Tripwire since 2010, this Agreement contains the 
parties' entire understanding relating to the subject matter and supersedes 
all prior or contemporaneous agreements. 

<p><b>1. ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT.</b>

<p>1.1 This Agreement allows Customer to license the software product version in 
which this Agreement is embedded ("Software") and to purchase support and 
maintenance for the Software ("Support"). The Software and Support are governed 
exclusively by the terms of the applicable end-user license agreement embedded 
in the Software, applicable product-specific terms at www.tripwire.com/terms, 
and, for orders placed directly with Tripwire, the applicable Tripwire 
quotation (collectively the "Order"). Purchase orders issued by Customer are 
for the sole purpose of identifying products, quantities, pricing, and delivery 
address; any additional or conflicting terms in Customer's purchase order will 
not be effective and are expressly declined. Terms in this Agreement relating 
to pricing, discounts and payments do not apply to Orders placed through an 
authorized reseller or distributor, and will be negotiated between Customer and 
the reseller or distributor. Distributors and resellers do not have the right 
to modify this Agreement or to make additional representations, commitments or 
warranties binding on Tripwire. Notwithstanding any reference to "purchase" in 
this Agreement or Order, Software is licensed, not sold.

<p>1.2 All fees are non-refundable, except as expressly provided in this 
Agreement. Any past due invoices are subject to interest charges of one and 
one-half percent per month or the applicable legal rate, whichever is lower. 
Fees quoted by Tripwire do not include freight, insurance, customs duties, 
taxes or other similar charges, which Tripwire will invoice separately. Unless 
Customer provides proof of exemption to Tripwire, Tripwire will invoice 
Customer for all applicable sales, value add or similar transaction-based 
taxes, itemized separately. Proof of exemption includes a resale certificate, 
an exemption certificate, a direct-pay permit or a letter from the tax 
jurisdiction authorizing the exemption. 

<p>1.3 All Software is delivered electronically or pre-installed on appliances. 
"Delivery" means the date on which Software delivered electronically is made 
available to Customer for download, or on which an appliance is delivered to 
the carrier. Tripwire's delivery of Software by electronic means is subject to 
Customer's provision of both a primary and an alternate e-mail address. Ship 
date is dependent on inventory lead times and order backlog. Tripwire will make 
reasonable efforts to ship within 30 days of order acceptance, and will provide 
the estimated ship date on request.

<p><b>2. OWNERSHIP; GRANT OF LICENSE.</b>

<p>2.1 Software, including all releases provided as part of Support, copies and 
documentation, is copyrighted, trade secret and Confidential Information of 
Tripwire or its licensors, who maintain exclusive title to all Software and 
retain all rights not expressly granted by this Agreement. Tripwire grants to 
Customer, subject to Customer's compliance with the Agreement terms including 
but not limited to payment of applicable license fees, a nontransferable, 
nonexclusive license to use Software solely: (a) in machine-readable, object or 
executable code form; (b) as specified in the Order; and (c) for Customer's 
internal business purposes.  Each Order for Software will identify the 
Software, license unit of measure, and any time period restriction, if 
applicable. Such limitations may be technically implemented through the use of 
authorization codes, license keys, or similar devices. 

<p>2.2 Customer agrees that purchases under this Agreement are not contingent on 
the delivery of any future functionality or features, and are not dependent on 
any oral or written comments made by Tripwire or its representatives regarding 
future functionality or features. Customer may choose, but is not required, to 
provide suggestions, data or other information to Tripwire regarding possible 
improvements in the operation, functionality or use of Software, in the course 
of receiving Support, evaluating Software or otherwise. Any inventions, product 
improvements, modifications or developments made by Tripwire are Tripwire's 
exclusive property.

<p>2.3 Customer shall not loan, rent, lease, distribute, or otherwise transfer 
Software without Tripwire's prior written consent, except as part of a 
permanent transfer of the Software as permitted by this Agreement. Customer may 
copy Software only as reasonably necessary to support the authorized use, as 
long as the number of licenses in use does not exceed the number of licenses 
purchased by Customer. Each copy must include all notices embedded in Software 
as received from Tripwire. All copies remain the property of Tripwire or its 
licensors. Customer shall not: (a) use the Software or allow its use for 
developing, enhancing or marketing any product that is competitive with the 
Software; or (b) disclose to any third party the results of or information 
pertaining to any testing of the Products against a third party's products for 
the purpose of competitive comparison.

<p>2.4 Except as otherwise permitted for interoperability as required by 
applicable law, Customer shall not reverse-assemble, reverse-compile, 
reverse-engineer or in any way derive source code from Software. If Customer 
wishes to exercise any rights to reverse-engineer to ensure interoperability in 
accordance with applicable law, Customer shall first provide Tripwire with 
written notice and all reasonably requested information to 
TW-Contracts@tripwire.com. Tripwire shall assess the claim, and may offer 
alternatives that reduce any adverse impact on Tripwire's intellectual property 
or other rights.

<p>2.5 Customer may allow third party consultants or contractors ("Authorized 
Third Parties") to access and use the Software on Customer's behalf as long as: 
(a) the use is solely for Customer's internal business operations; (b) each 
Authorized Third Party is under written confidentiality obligations with 
Customer protecting Tripwire's intellectual property and Confidential 
Information with terms no less stringent than this Agreement; (c) Customer 
ensures that the Authorized Third Party's use of the Software complies with the 
terms of this Agreement; and (d) on completion of the Authorized Third Party's 
services requiring use of the Software, Customer ensures that the Software are 
immediately and completely uninstalled from Authorized Third Party's equipment 
and/or premises, as applicable. 

<p>2.6 Customer may move the Software: (a) from one node to another node of the 
same type; and (b) from one site to another site, without charge. No transfer 
under this section shall increase the license scope or number of nodes in use 
by Customer. Except as provided herein, Customer shall not sublicense, assign 
or otherwise transfer the Software without Tripwire's prior written consent and 
payment of Tripwire's then-current applicable transfer charges. Except as 
permitted under this Agreement, any attempted transfer without Tripwire's prior 
written consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement and may, at 
Tripwire's option, result in the immediate termination of the licenses and this 
Agreement. 

<p>2.7 All Software is commercial off-the-shelf computer software. Pursuant to 
US FAR 48 CFR 12.212 and DFAR 48 CFR 227.7202, use, duplication and disclosure 
of the Software by or for the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government 
subcontractor is subject solely to the terms of this Agreement, except for 
terms that are contrary to applicable mandatory federal laws. Unless otherwise 
agreed to in writing by authorized personnel of Tripwire and Customer, no term 
or condition required in any U.S. Government contract or related subcontract 
shall be part of an Order or binding upon Tripwire.

<p><b>3. BETA CODE.</b> If Customer chooses to participate in a beta test program, the 
following terms apply to the beta test Software:

<p>3.1 Tripwire may offer pre-release code for experimental testing and evaluation 
("Beta Code"). If Tripwire authorizes Customer to use Beta Code, Tripwire 
grants to Customer a temporary, nontransferable, nonexclusive license for 
experimental use to test and evaluate Beta Code in a non-production 
environment, without charge for up to 60 days unless otherwise specified by 
Tripwire in writing. Tripwire has no obligation to offer a commercial version 
of the Beta Code in any form.

<p>3.2 Customer will evaluate Beta Code under normal conditions as directed by 
Tripwire. Customer acknowledges the experimental nature of Beta Code and agrees 
not to rely on correct functioning or performance of Beta Code. Customer will 
contact Tripwire periodically during Customer's use of Beta Code to discuss any 
malfunctions or suggested improvements. On completion of Customer's evaluation, 
Customer will send a written evaluation, which may be in the form of an email, 
of Beta Code to Tripwire, including its strengths, weaknesses and recommended 
improvements.

<p>3.3 Customer agrees to maintain Beta Code in confidence and to restrict access 
to Beta Code, including any functionality, methods and concepts, solely to 
those employees authorized to perform Beta Code testing. Any written 
evaluations and all inventions, product improvements, modifications or 
developments that Tripwire conceived or made during or after this Agreement, 
including those based partly or wholly on Customer's feedback, are the 
exclusive property of Tripwire, who has exclusive rights, title and interest in 
all such property. 

<p><b>4. SUPPORT.</b> 

<p>4.1 Any Support purchased by Customer will be identified in an Order. Support 
is generally offered in one-year increments, unless the Order states otherwise. 
If Customer purchases Support for Software, Tripwire will provide Customer with 
technical support and new releases that Tripwire makes generally available in 
accordance with Tripwire's Support Policies in effect at the commencement of 
each Support term, found at www.tripwire.com/terms. On Customer's installation 
of a new release of the Software, Customer shall stop using and remove the same 
number of licenses of the prior release of the Software, so that the total 
number of licensed copies of the Software remains the same. 

<p>4.2 Each Order must include at least one year of Support. Unless the Order 
states otherwise, the Support term begins on Delivery and the next period's 
Support renewal fee, if purchased, will not increase by more than 5% over the 
Support unit price for the initial term. If Support is not renewed by the 
expiration date of the initial Support term, pricing is subject to 
renegotiation and reinstatement fees will apply.

<p><b>5. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</b>

<p>5.1 "Confidential Information" means: (a) byte code or source code provided by 
Tripwire; (b) any authorization keys and passwords delivered in order to 
operate the Software; (c) Documentation, product road maps and development 
plans, and pricing information; (d) any Tripwire business, technical or 
training information that, if disclosed in writing, is marked "confidential" or 
"proprietary" at the time of disclosure, or, if disclosed orally, is identified 
as "confidential" or "proprietary" at the time of disclosure; and (e) the 
specific business terms and pricing set forth in any Order or this Agreement. 
Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes 
generally known or available to the public through no act or omission of 
Customer; (ii) is rightfully known to or received by Customer prior to 
receiving such information from Tripwire or its representatives without 
restriction as to use or disclosure; or (iii) is independently developed by 
Customer without use of Confidential Information and without a breach of this 
Agreement. The existence of this Agreement and the nature of the business 
relationship between the parties are not Confidential Information.

<p>5.2 Customer will not use Confidential Information except as necessary to 
exercise the rights granted under this Agreement or to evaluate opportunities 
to license additional Tripwire product offerings. Customer will not disclose 
Confidential Information to any person or entity except to employees or 
Authorized Third Parties whose job performance requires access and who are 
under confidentiality obligations. The foregoing obligations will not restrict 
Customer's disclosure of Confidential Information to the extent required by an 
order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental 
body, provided that Customer gives reasonable notice to Tripwire to contest 
such order or requirement. Customer shall give Tripwire written notice of any 
unauthorized disclosure or use of the Software as soon as Customer learns or 
becomes aware of the unauthorized disclosure or use.

<p><b>6. LIMITED WARRANTY.</b>

<p>6.1 During the warranty period, Tripwire warrants that the unmodified, 
generally available Software (excluding Beta Code), when properly installed, 
will substantially conform to the functional specifications in the applicable 
Tripwire user documentation for the Software, available from the Tripwire 
Customer Center ("Documentation"). The warranty period is 90 days from the date 
of Delivery. Customer must notify Tripwire in writing of any nonconformity 
within the warranty period. The Software warranty applies only to the initial 
Delivery of the Software and does not renew with the delivery of additional 
licenses, new releases or additional authorization codes. 

<p>6.2 This limited warranty does not apply to nonconformities caused by misuse, 
modification, abnormal physical or electrical stress, accident or improper 
installation. TRIPWIRE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR A 
BREACH OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY SHALL BE, AT TRIPWIRE'S OPTION, EITHER 
(A) MODIFICATION OR REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE THAT DOES NOT MEET THIS LIMITED 
WARRANTY, PROVIDED CUSTOMER HAS OTHERWISE COMPLIED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR 
(B) TRIPWIRE SHALL REFUND THE PRICE PAID UPON RETURN OF THE DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE 
TO TRIPWIRE AND A CERTIFICATION THAT CUSTOMER HAS DESTROYED ALL COPIES OF SUCH 
SOFTWARE. 

<p>6.3 THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6 IS EXCLUSIVE. NEITHER 
TRIPWIRE NOR ITS LICENSORS OFFER ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, TERMS OR CONDITIONS, 
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE OR OTHER MATERIAL 
PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. TRIPWIRE OFFERS NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE 
WILL DETECT OR PROTECT AGAINST ALL THREATS OR BE ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM 
INTERRUPTIONS OR OTHER FAILURES. TRIPWIRE OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO: 
SOFTWARE WHICH IS LICENSED AT NO CHARGE OR BETA CODE, BOTH OF WHICH ARE 
PROVIDED "AS IS." TRIPWIRE AND ITS LICENSORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND REPRESENTATIONS: (A) OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND (B) ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR 
TRADE. No oral or written information or advice given by Tripwire or Tripwire's 
authorized representatives shall create a warranty or other obligations on 
behalf of Tripwire. 

<p>6.4 Customer is responsible for selecting and using the Software to achieve 
Customers' intended results. Customer will indemnify Tripwire and its licensors 
from any third-party claims, loss, cost, damage, expense or liability, 
including attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with Customer's 
failure to maintain a secure or compliant system. As conditions to Customer's 
obligations under this Section 6.4, Tripwire must: (a) notify Customer promptly 
in writing of the action; and (b) grant Customer sole authority and control of 
the defense or settlement of the action.

<p><b>7. INFRINGEMENT.</b>

<p>7.1 Tripwire will defend or settle any action brought against Customer and pay 
all costs, damages and reasonable attorneys' fees that are finally awarded 
against Customer or are included in a settlement to which Tripwire is a party, 
to the extent those amounts are based upon a claim arising during a Support 
term, that the Software directly infringes any copyright or misappropriates any 
trade secret or infringes any U.S. patent. Customer agrees that as conditions 
to Tripwire's obligations under this Section 7, Customer must: (a) notify 
Tripwire promptly in writing of the action; (b) provide Tripwire all reasonable 
information and assistance to settle or defend the action at Tripwire's request 
and expense; and (c) grant Tripwire sole authority and control of the defense 
or settlement of the action. Tripwire will not be responsible for any 
compromise made or expense incurred without its prior written consent.

<p>7.2 If a claim is made under Subsection 7.1, Tripwire shall at its expense 
either: (a) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing; 
(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Software; or (c) if 
neither 7.2(a) nor 7.2(b) is commercially reasonable, require the return of the 
Software or, if obtained electronically, require a certification from Customer 
that the Software has been destroyed, and refund to Customer (i) for perpetual 
licenses, any purchase price or license fee paid, less an allowance for use 
based on a five year straight line depreciation method beginning on the 
Delivery of the Software; and (ii) for subscription licenses, the fees prepaid 
for the balance of the current term. 

<p>7.3 Tripwire is not liable for claims based on: (a) combination of Software 
with any product not furnished by Tripwire; (b) modification of Software other 
than by Tripwire; (c) modifications made by Tripwire in conformance with 
Customer's specifications; (d) use of other than a current unaltered release of 
Software; (e) any Beta Code; or (f) Software not used in accordance with this 
Agreement. 

<p>7.4. THIS SECTION 7 SETS FORTH TRIPWIRE'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND 
CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OR 
MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND. EXCEPT AS SET 
FORTH ABOVE, TRIPWIRE AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED OBLIGATIONS WITH 
RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION.

<p><b>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b>

<p>8.1 Tripwire's liability shall not be limited or excluded in relation to: 
(a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or intentional misconduct 
(or that of its employees or agents); (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or 
(c) any other liability that cannot under applicable law be limited or excluded.

<p>8.2 SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.1, NEITHER TRIPWIRE NOR ITS LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE 
FOR: (A) LOSS OF PROFITS; (B) LOSS OF DATA; (C) LOSS OF REVENUE; (D) LOSS OF 
USE; OR (E) PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL 
THEORY, EVEN IF TRIPWIRE OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<p>8.3 SUBJECT TO SECTION 8.1, NEITHER TRIPWIRE'S NOR ITS LICENSORS' LIABILITY 
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL EXCEED IN AGGREGATE, THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT 
PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM FOR THE 
SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; OR (B) $10,000. 

<p>8.4 The fees reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this Agreement. The 
parties would not enter into this Agreement without this risk allocation. Some 
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for 
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation may not apply to 
the extent prohibited by such local laws.

<p>8.5 Tripwire's Software is developed for general use in a variety of 
information management environments. They are not designed for use in a 
situation in which use or failure of the Software could lead to death or 
serious bodily injury of any person, or severe physical or environmental damage 
("High Risk Activities"). Examples of High Risk Activities include, without 
limitation, the design or operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation 
or communication systems, air traffic control, weapons systems, or direct 
life-support systems. If Customer uses the Software in High Risk Activities, 
Customer shall be solely responsible for taking all appropriate fail-safe, 
backup, redundancy and other measures to ensure the safe use of such Software. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, TRIPWIRE DISCLAIMS 
ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN HIGH RISK 
ACTIVITIES.

<p><b>9. TERM AND TERMINATION.</b>

<p>9.1 Term and Termination of Licenses. If a Software license or subscription was 
provided for a limited term ("Term Based License"), such Term Based License 
will automatically terminate on expiration of the term. Perpetual Software 
licenses will continue indefinitely under the terms of this Agreement, unless 
such licenses are terminated pursuant to this Section 9.1. Either party may 
terminate any license or subscription granted hereunder with 30 days' written 
notice to the other party if the other party is in material breach of the 
license or subscription (including non-payment) and fails to cure the breach 
within the 30-day notice period. In addition, Customer may terminate any 
license or subscription granted hereunder at any time by written notice to 
Tripwire. If a license or subscription is terminated, Customer shall stop all 
use of the affected Software, and shall certify the destruction of all copies 
of Software that had been subject to the terminated license or subscription, at 
Tripwire's written request. 

<p>9.2 Termination of Support. Support is provided for a specific term, and 
automatically terminates on expiration of the term. Either party may terminate 
Support with 30 days' written notice to the other party if the other party is 
in material breach of the Support (including non-payment) and fails to cure the 
breach within a 30-day notice period. Termination of Support under this Section 
9.2 does not automatically terminate any license.

<p>9.3 Effect of Termination. Termination of any license, subscription, or Support 
will not affect Customer's obligation to pay for licenses granted or Support 
provided prior to the termination, which amounts shall immediately be payable 
at the date of termination. The following sections will survive any termination 
of this Agreement: 1.2 (Orders, Fees, and Payment), 2 (Ownership, Grant of 
License), 3.3 (Beta Code), 4 (Support), 5 (Confidential Information), 
6 (Limited Warranty), 7.4 (Infringement), 8 (Limitation of Liability), 
9 (Term and Termination), 10 (Additional Terms).

<p><b>10. ADDITIONAL TERMS.</b> 

<p>10.1 Export. Customer shall comply with all international and national laws 
that apply to the Software, including U.S. Export Administration Regulations, 
economic sanctions regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, as well as similar restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments, 
which prohibit the provision of Software to specified destinations, end-users 
and end uses. Customer specifically represents and warrants that it will not 
export, re-export, sell, supply or transfer the Software in violation of local 
laws or to any country or person to which the United States has embargoed or 
restricted the provision of the Software, including, but not limited to, Cuba, 
Iran, North Korea, Sudan (North) or Syria, nationals of those countries, or to 
any other embargoed or restricted destination or person.

<p>10.2 Review of License Usage. On Tripwire's written request, Customer will 
furnish to Tripwire: (a) a certification signed by an officer indicating 
whether the Software is being used in accordance with this Agreement; and 
(b) a copy of any usage reports generated from the Software, if applicable. If 
Customer usage exceeds the number licenses purchased, then Customer will 
promptly pay Tripwire for actual usage based on Tripwire's then-current list 
price. With prior written notice, Tripwire may engage an independent auditor to 
review Customer's Software usage and related records during Customer's normal 
business hours to confirm compliance with this Agreement (a "Review"). Customer 
will provide the auditor with access to the relevant records and facilities for 
the Review. Tripwire will treat all information disclosed during the Review as 
confidential information and will only use or disclose such information as 
required by law or to enforce its rights under this Agreement. 

<p>10.3 Third Party Code. The Software contains or is accompanied by certain third 
party software components ("Third-Party Code") identified at 
www.tripwire.com/terms ("Third-Party Notices"). The Third Party Notices may 
include important licensing and liability disclaimers from the Third-Party Code 
licensors. Customer's use of Third-Party Code in conjunction with the Software 
in accordance with this Agreement is permitted under all such Third-Party 
Notices. Customer acknowledges that Sections 6.1 and 7.1 of this Agreement do 
not apply to the Third-Party Code.

<p>10.4 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed 
under the laws of the State of Oregon, USA, excluding choice of laws rules. Any 
action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement, must be 
brought in a federal court in the District of Oregon or in state court in 
Multnomah County, Oregon, and each party irrevocably submits to the 
jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding. This 
Section 10.4 shall not restrict Tripwire's right to bring an action against 
Customer in the jurisdiction where Customer's place of business is located. The 
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does 
not apply to this Agreement.

<p>10.5 Assignment. Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement by the Customer 
is prohibited without the prior written consent of Tripwire, and any attempted 
transfer or assignment without such consent shall be void and without force or 
effect. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding on permitted successors in 
interest and assigns. 

<p>10.6 Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for default or delay in 
performing its obligations due to causes beyond its reasonable control, as long 
as such causes continue and the party continues to use commercially reasonable 
efforts to resume performance. If any such default or delay extends for more 
than 60 days, the other party shall have the right, without obligation or 
liability, to cancel any Order or portion thereof affected by such default or 
delay.

<p>10.7 Severability; Modification; Notice; Waiver. If a court of competent 
jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, 
that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other 
provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This 
Agreement may only be modified in writing by authorized representatives of the 
parties. All notices required or authorized under this Agreement must be in 
writing and shall be sent, as applicable, to the other party's legal department 
at the address set forth above, or to such other notice address as the parties 
specify in writing. Waiver of terms or excuse of breach must be in writing and 
shall not constitute subsequent consent, waiver or excuse.
